              First and foremost, I am a follower of Christ. I care more than I can express and less than I should about God and my fellow brothers. I'm currently a student on my last semester at Texas A&M University studying Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics.

              This website is a personal site intended to be a showcase for work that I've done and thoughts that I have. It will likely always be a WIP.
