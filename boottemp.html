            <h1><b>Does God Exist? </b><small>Part 1</small></h1>
          </div>

          <p>
            Perhaps the most basic question ever asked is : How did I and everything around me come into being?
          </p>
          <p>
            The argument, which is really quite simple, looks something like this:
          </p>
  
          <ol>
            <li>The universe exists.</li>
            <li>The universe does not have to exist.</li>
            <li>If the universe didn’t have to exist, then the universe has a cause for its existence.</li>
            <li>Therefore, the universe has an uncaused cause.</li>
          </ol>
  
          <h3><b>1.The universe exists.</b></h3>
          <p>
            This idea is rather simple which is why I’m not going to say much about it. We experience the things around us. We dsee. We touch. We smell. We hear. Our world is tangible and, therefore, undeniable, exists.
          </p>
  
          <h3><b>2.The universe does not have to exist.</b></h3>
          <p>
            In other words, the universe does not exist by necessity. For instance, why does the universe have to have life in it? We can see other planets in our own solar system that don’t have life. Life doesn't exist necessarily. Our existence does not perpetuate or sustain the existence of the stars, the planets, the universe. Furthermore, why does the universe have to exist at all? There could have just been absolute nothingness instead. Why not? We wouldn’t have known if it were.
          </p>
  
          <h3><b>3.The universe has a cause for its existence.</b></h3>
          <p>
            This statement is a logical progression from the first two. If we are something rather than nothing and the something didn't have to be there, then there has to be a reason for its existence. If things didn't require a cause to exist, then things would just pop into existence. By chance, a giraffe could just appear in an office building because no cause was required for it to happen.
          </p>
  
          <h3><b>4.The universe has an uncaused cause that exists by necessity.</b></h3>
          <p>
            So by this point, we've concluded that there was a cause to the universe. No other truthful explanation exists. What is the cause for our universe? Wait....if there has to be a cause for something to exist, and our universe was caused by a cause, what caused that cause? And what caused the cause that caused the cause? My brain hurts. This line of questioning is the exact issue that scientists have struggled with for centuries. At some point, there has to be something that has no cause: an uncaused or first cause. This is the only way to explain the beginnings of our universe. Without it, we would be stuck in an infinite search for the cause that caused the cause that caused the cause that caused the cause...you get the idea. In contrast to our universe, this cause must exist by necessity of its nature. This cause is so necessary to existence that it is the beginning, the first, the origin of all. Otherwise, it would also require an explanation and we would be back where we started.
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Remember a time when you had to define a word for someone. When explaining what a word means, defining a word to them in terms of another word that they don’t know doesn’t tell that person what the original word means. In the same way, saying that the universe had an infinite chain of causes rather than a first cause does not explain how the universe got here. It merely delays and complicates the explanation.
          </p>
  
          <h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3>
          <p>
            Some have argued that the universe itself has always been, needing no further explanation. However, even scientists are not satisfied by such a dismissive and unfounded assertion. Something cannot come from nothing, and there would be far too many instances of that if our universe has always been. By showing that the universe has a cause that was uncaused and exists by necessity, we open the door to asking "who or what is this uncaused cause?" This question is answered more fully in the next article.
